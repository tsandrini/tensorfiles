* About
These are my personal dotfiles. They are probably not neither up to date or
complete since I really hate this style of personal system managment and that
is the reason (one of many) why I will be probably switching to [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]]. That
doesn't mean that I dislike [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch]], quite on the contrary, however, after all
these years I don't really enjoy literally wasting time over and over
wiring and fixing basic unix stuff which could be once for all solved in a nice
declarative way :smirk-cat:.
Apart from that, I am really enjoying xmonad so far, it's interesting what a
significant performance difference it is from let's say i3 -- in this regard
it's kinda similar to dwm, however, I've always hated the patching system
of suckless software, I mean, it's really nice in theory, but when you
constantly have to debug your setup with valgrind/gdb in order for your
environment to work, it gets annoying really fast.
* Software
I use the following software
