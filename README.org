* Update [19.01.23]
As of now I've completely commited to the nix ecosystem and I am in the process
of rewriting everything into a [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] + [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Flakes]] + [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][Home-manager]] pipeline managing
all of my machines. Aside from that I am experimenting with opt-in based
filesystems as well, therefore all of this is still in the early phases
an can be seen in the =nix/= directory and probably shouldn't be used by
anyone else at this moment. My old symlink based configuration files of
various applications are still all there in the =dotfiles/= folder and those
should be working just fine and can be used elsewhere if you wish so.

When all of this is going to be done I'll properly comment/cleanup the
repository and archive the old symlink based config.

Thanks <3.

The whole nix ecosystem is in its foundations a revolutionary piece of
software and once you get the hang of it you feel like you've really
conquered the art of computer wizardry, however, it's so different from
everything that is the current status quo of compsci and thus needs
appropriate extensive documentation/tutorials/etc... which is, however,
currently no the case.

Due to this exact reason I'm leaving here a list of resources/flakes that
helped me to (somewhat) learn the ways of nix (TODO: maybe write more? manual.org?)
