## 1. About ‚ùÑÔ∏è

**tensorfiles** represent a set of _fully covariant_, that is invariant to the
chosen coordinate system (**they work on every machine**), fundamental
laws of computing (**how to build my fancy flashy terminals**) ‚òÅÔ∏è

For more info refer to the [documentation](https://tsandrini.github.io/tensorfiles/).
The project is also hosted on [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com/flake/tsandrini/tensorfiles/).

## 2. Design choices ‚öôÔ∏è

- This project follow the following template
  [https://github.com/tsandrini/practical-flakes-template](https://github.com/tsandrini/practical-flakes-template)
  which makes it super easy to share modularity between different projects.
- Modules are disabled by default. Why you might ask? ü§ì ... Setting
  `myModule.enable = true;` can be done from multiple places, moreover we can
  even assign priorities to these expressions (by utilising `lib.mkOverride`),
  however, we can import a given module once and only once ... additional imports
  will yield errors. This behaviour makes it hard to reason about the dependencies
  of individual modules, which is why I opted for the behaviour --
  import everything and enable only the parts that you need.
- Use **profiles** to define and share common configurations packs. Profiles
  typically don't create and add any new functionality but instead preconfigure
  stuff.
- Isolate home manager functionality in such a way so it can be used in non
  NixOS environments üë•
- I prefer to only use `inputs` and `system` variables instead of the more
  convenient `inputs'` and `self'` of flake-parts due to the code being easier
  to copy and transfer to older non flake-parts codebases.

## 3. Software üñ•Ô∏è

I have a bunch of machines running some nix or directly NixOS with a variety
of setups. To discern between them but still use the same base I use nixos/hm
modules and their appropriate profiles.

### 3.1. Academia üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíº

1. [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/): This is the heart of everything that I
   do, TODOs, daily journals, scratchpads, notetaking and personal research wiki.
   The internal wiki is interlinked with zotero entries as well as anki cards.
   - TODOs: [org-agenda](https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html)
   - visualization: [org-roam-ui](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui)
   - anki connection: [org-anki-editor](https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor)
     ![img](parts/pkgs/docs/docs/assets/images/showcase_org_roam_ui.png)
2. [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): This is my backend for all of my
   bibliography as well as the individual `.pdf` files. As of now I keep them up
   to date between machines using [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), but
   I&rsquo;ll probably set up a personal cloud when I&rsquo;ll have spare time.
3. [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/): Since I have the memory of worm I try to
   keep my long-term memory of different subjects fresh using flashcards. I sync
   the cards using ankis official cloud.

### 3.2. Secrets üîë

For my day to day passwords I use a locally synced
[keepassxc](https://keepassxc.org/) encrypted database and for the NixOS based
secrets I use [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix). I also try to avoid
using any globally available pubkeys and rather tend to use machine specific
ones instead (for obvious reasons).

_Note_: plz no pwn xd, if you see any vulnerabilities please DM me instead,
thanks <3.

## 4. Installation üíæ

TODO

## 5. Troubleshooting üòµ‚Äçüí´

### `Write error: disk full;` during `nixos-install`

If you get any error of this kind during the installation of this flake
you have most likely run out of `$TMPDIR` space. This is usually due
to `$TMPDIR` being set up as a RAM based tmpfs and thus not having enough
RAM for nix store cache during installation.

The most clean & general solution to this would be to create a minimal
based installation and then run a `nixos-rebuild` (and I still might do that)
but that kind of defeats the purpose of what I am aiming for which would be
to run `nixos-install`, a single command, and end up with a fully prepared
system.

Considering that a quick workaround is to navigate `$TMPDIR` to a different
folder (this might slow the installation process if you redirect it to a
spinning disk tmp filesystem, however, assuming you have a decent bandwidth
is&rsquo;s still just by minutes)

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/tmp
USER=$USER TMPDIR="/mnt/tmp" nixos-install --root /mnt --flake .#$HOST
```

A different solution in case you have more spare RAM would be to remount
tmpfs, for example

```bash
mount -o remount,size=15G /tmp
```

## 6. Impurities üí©

- some of the packages in [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) require
  running `--impure`
- devenv requires `--impure` flag for commands

## 7. References üìö

The whole nix ecosystem is in its foundations a revolutionary piece of
software and once you get the hang of it you feel like you&rsquo;ve really
conquered the art of computer wizardry, however, it&rsquo;s so different from
everything that is the current status quo of compsci and thus needs
appropriate extensive documentation/tutorials/etc&#x2026; which is, however,
currently not the case.

Due to this exact reason I&rsquo;m leaving here a list of resources/flakes that
helped me to (somewhat) learn the ways of nix (TODO: maybe write more?
manual.org?)
